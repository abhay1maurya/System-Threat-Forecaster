# Malware Infection Prediction Competition

## Dataset Description
The goal of this competition is to predict a system’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system.  
The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by the system's antivirus software.

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a `MachineID`.  
`target` is the ground truth and indicates that malware was detected on the machine.  
Using the information and labels in `train.csv`, you must predict the value for `target` for each machine in `test.csv`.
